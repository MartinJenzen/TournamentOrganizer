**TODO**
-
- Standardize color themes
- More error handling
- Clean up CSS (especially containers, Table.css and TournamentPage.css)
- More error response messages to users
- Add loading indicators while fetching data
- Unit tests
- More separation of concerns in \routes\tournaments.ts
- Atomize huge functions:
  - 'generateInitialKnockoutMatchesFromGroups' in matchFixturesHelper.ts
- Make UI design more sexier (e.g., see TournamentPage.css for experiement and for inspiration: https://www.premierleague.com/en)
  - Use consistent spacing and alignment
  - Improve color contrast and readability
  - Enhance button styles and interactions
- Optimize database queries to reduce latency (select only necessary fields)
- Ensure returned status codes are correct (400 vs. 500)
- Transition to Prisma 7 (settings.json)
- Stop group tables from being updated in Knockout phase
- If an existing match report is edited (after having been played), the result of this change should be reflected in which team either advances from either a group or knockout tie 
- Fix bug where the next knockout (maybe also regular) match is created within the previous match day, that was already played (related to editing existing match reports multiple times)
- Show cup playoff tree/brackets on OrganizeTeamsPage
- Fix bug that causes the side panel to be scrollable
- In top players list for goals/assists: if two players with the same name exist, show their team as well (CHE, LIV, etc.)
