**TODO**
-
- Standardize color themes
- More error handling
- Clean up CSS (especially containers, Table.css and TournamentPage.css)
- Transition to Tailwind CSS or SCSS
- More error response messages to users
- Add loading indicators while fetching data
- Unit tests
- More separation of concerns in \routes\tournaments.ts
- Make UI design more sexier (e.g., see TournamentPage.css for experiement and for inspiration: https://www.premierleague.com/en)
  - Use consistent spacing and alignment
  - Improve color contrast and readability
  - Enhance button styles and interactions
- Optimize database queries to reduce latency (select only necessary fields)
- Ensure returned status codes are correct (400 vs. 500)
- Transition to Prisma 7 (settings.json)
- If an existing match report is edited (after having been played), the result of this change should be reflected in which team either advances from either a group or knockout tie 
- Fix bug where the next knockout (maybe also regular) match is created within the previous match day, that was already played (related to editing existing match reports multiple times)
- Show cup playoff tree/brackets on OrganizeTeamsPage
- BUG: fix bug that causes the side panel to be scrollable
- In top players list for goals/assists: if two players with the same name exist, show their team as well (CHE, LIV, etc.) 
- Replace 'any' types with proper types wherever possible
- BUG: fix issue where the wrong team of two, with exact same stats (W, D, L, etc.), in same group, advances to knockout stage (e.g., 3rd place team advances instead of 2nd place team)
